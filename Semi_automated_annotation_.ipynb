It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

            "[48:47.800 --> 48:49.800]  It's been absorbing.\n",

            "[01:29:45.480 --> 01:30:12.920]  this way. That's the third and final change. Ronaldo goes down, gets a free kick.\n",
            "[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:40.360]  Challenges by Piquet. Now, this is a key moment. We know who's going to strike it.\n",
            "[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:51.680]  A little over three minutes plus additional time remaining, as so often. Portugal's hopes\n",

            "[01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:38.720]  broken right at the end. It's his sixth hat-trick for Portugal, his 51st in his career. And it's\n",
            "[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:51.360]  the 51st hat-trick at a World Cup finals. Late goals most certainly are a feature of\n",

            "[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:24.080]  and it's far from finished as we go into the last minute of the regulation 90 plus whatever\n",
