# 🎥 **SAAT - Semi-Automated Annotation Technique**  
📌 **Project Name:** SAAT - Semi-Automated Annotation Technique  
🎯 **Goal:** Automate and speed up the process of annotating sports videos using speech-to-text and AI-powered action recognition.  

---

## 📜 **Overview**  
SAAT is a **semi-automated annotation pipeline** that extracts commentary from sports videos, converts speech to text, and generates annotations based on detected keywords or AI-driven models. This helps reduce manual effort in labeling match events for training AI models, analytics, or content creation.

## 🛠️ **Workflow**  
1️⃣ **Match Video Input**  
   - A match video is provided as input.  

2️⃣ **Extract Audio**  
   - The system extracts the audio track (`.mp3`) from the video.  

3️⃣ **Speech-to-Text Model**  
   - Converts commentary into transcribed text.  

4️⃣ **Two Annotation Paths:**  
   - **🔍 LLM-Based Annotation**  
     - Uses a large language model (LLM) to generate annotations based on context.  
   - **🗝️ Keyword-to-Action Mapping**  
     - Detects specific keywords (e.g., "goal," "foul") and maps them to predefined actions.  

5️⃣ **Annotations Output**  
   - The generated annotations are stored/exported for further processing.  

🔗 **Temporal Annotation and Visualization Tool**  
   - For more advanced annotation and visualization, you can use the [Soccer Event Annotation Tool](https://github.com/ibrahimabdelaal/Soccer-event-annotation-tool).
